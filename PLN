As a user, I want to be able to track the work I need to do, and to have the system automatically figure out how I need to order my dependencies.

Concepts:

Task - something you need to do

Tasks have a description, dependents and dependencies.
Users can create them, and link them.
They also have a completion boolean, and an archived boolean.
